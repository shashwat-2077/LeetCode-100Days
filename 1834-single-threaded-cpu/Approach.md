## The code is an implementation of a SingleThreadedCPU class that processes a list of tasks using a priority queue (min-heap) to determine the order in which tasks are executed. 

### Let's break down the approach step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The class `SingleThreadedCPU` contains a method called `getOrder` that takes a 2D array `tasks` as input. Each row in the `tasks` array represents a task with two values: the time the task enters the system (`tasks[i][0]`) and the time it takes to process the task (`tasks[i][1]`).

2. **Preparing the Task Array:**
   - An array `A` of size `n` (number of tasks) is created to store task information along with their indices. Each element in `A` is a 3-element array:
     - `A[i][0]`: The entry time of the task.
     - `A[i][1]`: The processing time of the task.
     - `A[i][2]`: The index of the task in the original array.

3. **Initializing Variables:**
   - `ans` is an array to store the final order of task execution.
   - `ansIndex` keeps track of the index in the `ans` array.
   - `minHeap` is a priority queue (min-heap) that stores instances of class `T`, representing tasks with their processing time and index.
   - `i` is used to iterate through the tasks array.
   - `time` represents the current time in the CPU's execution.

4. **Sorting the Task Array:**
   - The array `A` is sorted based on the entry time of tasks using `Arrays.sort()` and a custom comparator.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop continues as long as there are tasks to process (`i < n`) or tasks in the min-heap (`!minHeap.isEmpty()`).
   - If the min-heap is empty, the CPU waits until the next task arrives by updating the `time` variable to the entry time of the next task (`A[i][0]`).
   - While there are tasks that have arrived and can be processed, they are added to the min-heap. The loop increments `i` to move to the next task.
   - The min-heap stores tasks based on their processing time. Tasks with shorter processing times will be at the top of the heap.

6. **Processing Tasks:**
   - The task with the smallest processing time (top of the min-heap) is retrieved.
   - The processing time and index of the retrieved task are used to update the `time` variable and record the task's index in the `ans` array.
   - The task is removed from the min-heap.

7. **Completion:**
   - The loop continues until all tasks have been processed. The order of task indices in the `ans` array represents the order in which tasks are executed to minimize the average waiting time.

8. **Returning the Result:**
   - The `ans` array, containing the order in which tasks were executed, is returned as the final output of the `getOrder` method.

## The overall approach aims to efficiently schedule and process tasks on a single CPU thread, prioritizing tasks with shorter processing times to minimize overall execution time. The use of a min-heap helps achieve this priority-based scheduling.
