â€‹## The code is an implementation of the "Minimum Spanning Tree" problem, which aims to find the minimum cost to connect all the given points in a graph. The code uses a heuristic algorithm to achieve this, and it's based on the concept of repeatedly connecting the two closest points until all points are connected.

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. Initialize an array `dist` of size equal to the number of points. `dist[i]` represents the minimum distance required to connect the point at index `i` to any other point in the graph. Initially, set all values in `dist` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

2. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0. This variable will store the total cost of connecting all points.

3. The algorithm proceeds through a series of iterations, where in each iteration, it connects two points with the smallest distance between them. The outer loop iterates over all points except the last one since it is connecting points[i] with points[i+1].

4. The inner loop, starting from `i + 1`, iterates over the remaining points (points after the current `i`), and for each pair of points `(i, j)`, calculates the Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in x and y coordinates) between them. This distance is stored in `dist[j]`.

5. After calculating the distance, there's a check to see if `dist[j]` is less than `dist[i + 1]`. If it is, this means that connecting `points[j]` to the cluster of points up to index `i` results in a shorter distance compared to connecting `points[i + 1]` to the cluster. In that case, the code swaps `points[j]` with `points[i + 1]` and updates the corresponding distances in `dist` accordingly. This is done to ensure that in each iteration, the point with the smallest remaining distance is considered for the next connection.

6. After updating `dist` and potentially swapping points, the code increments `ans` by the value of `dist[i + 1]`. This step represents connecting the point at index `i + 1` to the existing cluster of connected points.

7. Repeat this process for all points except the last one.

8. Once the outer loop is complete, `ans` will hold the minimum cost to connect all points in a manner that forms a Minimum Spanning Tree.

9. Return `ans` as the final result, which represents the minimum cost to connect all points.

## This algorithm doesn't necessarily guarantee the absolute minimum cost in all cases, as it's a heuristic approach. However, it often provides a reasonable approximation for many practical problems and can be efficient for a moderate number of points. The algorithm's time complexity is O(N^2), where N is the number of points, making it less suitable for a large number of points.
