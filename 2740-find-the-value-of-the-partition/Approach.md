### Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Class Name and Method Declaration**:
   - The code defines a Java class called `FindtheValueofthePartition`.
   - Inside this class, there is a public method named `findValueOfPartition`.
   - The method takes an integer array `nums` as its parameter and returns an integer.

2. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The method initializes an integer variable `ans` with the maximum possible integer value, which is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
   - This value is used to keep track of the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted array `nums`.

3. **Sorting the `nums` Array**:
   - The `nums` array is sorted in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort(nums)` method.
   - Sorting the array allows us to easily calculate the minimum difference between adjacent elements.

4. **Iterating Over the Sorted Array**:
   - A `for` loop is used to iterate through the sorted `nums` array.
   - The loop starts at index 1 (`int i = 1`) and goes up to one less than the length of the array (`i < nums.length`).

5. **Calculating Minimum Difference**:
   - Inside the loop, the code calculates the difference between the current element (`nums[i]`) and the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`).
   - The difference is calculated as `nums[i] - nums[i - 1]`.

6. **Updating `ans`**:
   - The calculated difference is then compared to the current value of `ans`.
   - If the calculated difference is smaller than the current value of `ans`, `ans` is updated to the smaller difference.
   - This ensures that `ans` always contains the minimum difference found so far in the array.

7. **Returning the Minimum Difference**:
   - After the loop finishes iterating over the sorted array, the method returns the final value of `ans`, which represents the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the sorted array.

## In summary, the purpose of this code is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the input integer array `nums` after sorting it in ascending order. The code achieves this by iterating through the sorted array and continuously updating the `ans` variable with the minimum difference found. Finally, it returns the minimum difference as the result.
