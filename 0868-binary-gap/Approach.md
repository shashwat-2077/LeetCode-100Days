## The given code is a Java class named `Binary_Gap` with a single method `binaryGap` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer representing the length of the longest binary gap in the binary representation of `n`. A binary gap is a sequence of consecutive zeros between two ones in the binary representation of a number.

### Let's break down the approach used in the code step by step:

1. Initialize a variable `ans` to store the maximum binary gap length. Initialize it to 0 initially.

2. Start a loop that iterates while `n` is greater than 0. This loop processes the binary digits of the given number.

3. Inside the loop, right-shift `n` by 1 (`n /= 2`) to check each bit of the binary representation. Also, increment a variable `d` by 1. `d` is used to keep track of the current gap length.

4. Check if the least significant bit of `n` is 1. This is done using the bitwise AND operator (`n & 1`). If it's 1, it means a new '1' bit is encountered in the binary representation.

5. If the current bit is 1, update the `ans` by taking the maximum of the current `ans` and the value of `d`. This is done because `d` holds the length of the previous gap, and we want to consider the maximum gap length.

6. Reset the value of `d` to 0. This is because we encountered a new '1' bit, and we need to start counting the gap length from zero again.

7. Continue the loop until all bits of the binary representation of `n` have been processed.

8. After the loop finishes, return the value of `ans`, which represents the longest binary gap length.

## In summary, the code iterates through the binary representation of the given number `n`. It keeps track of the gap length between consecutive '1' bits using the `d` variable and updates the maximum gap length (`ans`) whenever a new '1' bit is encountered. The final value of `ans` after processing all the bits represents the length of the longest binary gap in the number's binary representation.
