## â€‹The Java code implements a function `intToRoman` that converts an integer `num` into its Roman numeral representation. It uses a straightforward approach by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the input number and appending the corresponding Roman symbols to a StringBuilder until the number becomes zero. 

### Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:

1. Define two arrays:
   - `values`: An array that stores the integer values associated with Roman numerals in descending order. This array is used to represent values like 1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, and 1.
   - `symbols`: An array that stores the corresponding Roman numeral symbols in the same order. This array is used to represent symbols like "M," "CM," "D," "CD," "C," "XC," "L," "XL," "X," "IX," "V," "IV," and "I."

2. Create a `StringBuilder` named `sb` to efficiently build the Roman numeral string.

3. Iterate through the `values` array from the largest value to the smallest value using a `for` loop.

4. Inside the loop, check if `num` is equal to zero. If it is, break out of the loop because there is no need to continue processing.

5. Within the loop, use a `while` loop to repeatedly subtract the current `values[i]` from `num` as long as `num` is greater than or equal to `values[i]`. This step ensures that we use the largest possible Roman numeral value without exceeding the input number.

6. Inside the `while` loop, subtract `values[i]` from `num` and append the corresponding Roman symbol `symbols[i]` to the `StringBuilder` `sb`.

7. Continue this process until `num` becomes zero or until all possible Roman numeral values have been considered.

8. After the loop completes, return the Roman numeral representation stored in the `StringBuilder` as a string using `sb.toString()`.

### Here's an example of how this code works:

Suppose `num` is 3549. The loop iterates through `values` and `symbols`, starting with the largest value, 1000 (M). The `while` loop subtracts 1000 from `num` and appends "M" to `sb` as long as `num` is greater than or equal to 1000. After this, `num` becomes 2549. The process continues with 900 (CM), 500 (D), and so on until `num` becomes 0. The final result is the Roman numeral representation "MMMDXLIX" for the input integer 3549.
