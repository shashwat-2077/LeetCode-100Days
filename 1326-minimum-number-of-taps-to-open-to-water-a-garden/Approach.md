1. **Input Parameters:**
   - `n`: Represents the length of the garden, or the number of points.
   - `ranges`: An array of length `n + 1` containing the ranges of the taps. Each element `ranges[i]` represents the maximum distance that the tap at position `i` can cover.

2. **Creating `nums` Array:**
   - Initialize an array `nums` of size `n + 1`. This array will store information about the farthest right boundary that can be covered by a tap placed at each position.
   
3. **Processing Tap Ranges:**
   - Iterate through each point in the garden, from `0` to `n` (inclusive), using the index variable `i`.
   - Calculate the left and right boundaries of the effective range of the tap at position `i`:
     - `l` (left boundary) is the maximum of `0` and `i - ranges[i]`.
     - `r` (right boundary) is the minimum of `n` and `i + ranges[i]`.
   - Calculate the range that the tap at position `i` covers, which is `r - l`.

4. **Updating `nums` Array:**
   - For each tap at position `i`, update the `nums` array at position `l` to store the maximum value between the current value at `nums[l]` and the range `r - l`. This step ensures that we store the maximum coverage that can be achieved from the same left boundary position.

5. **Initializing Variables:**
   - Initialize three variables:
     - `ans` (answer): Represents the minimum number of taps required to cover the garden.
     - `end`: Keeps track of the farthest right boundary covered by the taps placed so far.
     - `farthest`: Represents the farthest right boundary that can be reached by placing a tap at the current position.

6. **Iterating Through Positions:**
   - Iterate through each position `i` from `0` to `n - 1` (inclusive) using a loop.
   - Update the `farthest` variable:
     - Calculate the maximum between the current value of `farthest` and the sum of the current position `i` and the value stored in the `nums` array at position `i`. This represents the right boundary that can be covered by a tap placed at position `i`.

7. **Placing Taps for Coverage:**
   - Check if the current position `i` is equal to the `end` variable:
     - If they are equal, it means that the farthest boundary that can be covered by the taps placed so far has been reached.
     - Increment the `ans` variable to represent the placement of another tap.
     - Update the `end` variable to the value of `farthest`. This simulates the process of placing a tap at the position that covers the maximum range within the current boundary.

8. **Returning Result:**
   - After iterating through all positions, return `ans` if the `end` variable is equal to `n`, indicating that the entire garden has been covered by the taps.
   - Otherwise, return `-1` indicating that it's not possible to cover the entire garden.

## This approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of taps required to cover the entire garden by determining the optimal placements of the taps and maintaining information about the farthest coverage achievable from each position.
