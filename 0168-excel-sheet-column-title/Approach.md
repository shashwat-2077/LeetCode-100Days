## The code defines a Java class named `ExcelSheetColumnTitle` that converts a column number in an Excel sheet to the corresponding column title.

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Class Definition**: The code defines a class named `ExcelSheetColumnTitle`.

2. **`convertToTitle` Method**:
   - The `convertToTitle` method takes an integer `columnNumber` as input and returns the corresponding column title as a string.
   - The method uses a recursive approach to convert the column number to its corresponding title.

3. **Base Case**:
   - The base case of the recursion is when the `columnNumber` is equal to 0. In this case, there is no corresponding title, so an empty string is returned.

4. **Recursive Conversion**:
   - If the `columnNumber` is not 0, the method proceeds with the recursive conversion.
   - The `(columnNumber-1)/26` part calculates the quotient of dividing `columnNumber-1` by 26. This is used to determine the previous set of characters in the title.
   - The `(char)('A' + ((columnNumber-1)%26))` part calculates the character that corresponds to the remainder of dividing `columnNumber-1` by 26. It adds the calculated character to the end of the title.

5. **Recursive Call**:
   - The method recursively calls itself with the quotient `(columnNumber-1)/26` as the new `columnNumber`.
   - The result of the recursive call represents the previous set of characters in the title.

6. **Concatenation**:
   - The character calculated in step 4 is concatenated with the result of the recursive call from step 5, forming the complete column title.

7. **Returning the Result**:
   - After all recursive calls are completed and concatenation is done, the method returns the final column title as a string.

## In summary, the code uses a recursive approach to convert a given column number into its corresponding Excel sheet column title. It calculates characters based on the remainder of the division and uses recursive calls to build the title progressively from the least significant character to the most significant character.
