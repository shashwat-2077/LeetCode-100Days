## â€‹The code defines a class `MinimumDeletionstoMakeArrayDivisible` with a method `minOperations` designed to find the minimum number of deletions needed from an integer array `nums` to make it divisible by another integer array `numsDivide`. 

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in this code:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The code starts by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the `numsDivide` array. The GCD is calculated using the `getGCD` method.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The `nums` array is sorted in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort` method. Sorting is important for the subsequent steps.

3. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array**:
   - The code then iterates through the sorted `nums` array in a `for` loop.
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the sorted array, it checks if the GCD calculated earlier (`gcd`) is divisible by `nums[i]` using the modulo operation (`gcd % nums[i] == 0`).

4. **Finding the First Divisible Element**:
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is divisible by the GCD, it means that the array `nums` can be made divisible by the array `numsDivide` by deleting elements. In this case, the code returns the index `i` as the minimum number of deletions needed.

5. **No Divisible Element Found**:
   - If the loop finishes without finding a divisible element, it means that it's not possible to make the array `nums` divisible by `numsDivide` by deleting elements. In this case, the code returns `-1` to indicate that it's not possible.

6. **GCD Calculation Method**:
   - The GCD is calculated using the `getGCD` method, which iterates through the `numsDivide` array and uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

7. **Euclidean GCD Algorithm**:
   - The `gcd` method implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two integers `a` and `b`. It continues to call itself recursively until `b` becomes zero, and then it returns `a` as the GCD.

## In summary, the code finds the minimum number of deletions needed in the `nums` array to make it divisible by the GCD of the `numsDivide` array. It does so by checking if any element in the sorted `nums` array is divisible by the GCD. If a divisible element is found, the index of that element is returned as the answer. If no such element is found, it returns `-1` to indicate that it's not possible to make `nums` divisible by deleting elements.
