## â€‹The given SQL query retrieves the names of employees (e1) who have a higher salary than their respective managers (e2). It achieves this by joining the "Employee" table with itself using aliases e1 and e2. 
### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in the query:

1. **SELECT Clause:**
   - The query begins by selecting the name of the employee (e1.name) who satisfies the specified conditions.

2. **FROM Clause:**
   - The query uses a self-join on the "Employee" table, creating two different instances (aliases) of the table: e1 and e2.
   - This allows us to compare different employees' salary information within the same table.

3. **JOIN Clause:**
   - The self-join is performed by joining e1 with e2 based on the condition e1.managerId = e2.id.
   - This condition links an employee with their respective manager.

4. **WHERE Clause:**
   - The WHERE clause filters the joined rows based on the condition e1.salary > e2.salary.
   - This condition checks if the salary of the employee (e1) is greater than the salary of their manager (e2).
   - If this condition is met, it means that the employee earns more than their manager.

5. **Result:**
   - The query retrieves and displays the names of employees (e1) who fulfill the salary comparison condition specified in the WHERE clause.

## In summary, the query compares the salary of each employee with the salary of their respective manager using a self-join. It then selects the names of employees who earn more than their managers and presents this information as the final result. This query helps identify employees who have a higher salary than their immediate supervisors.
