1. **Input Conversion:**
   - The method `minimumSum` takes an integer `num` as input. This integer represents a 4-digit number.

2. **Digit Extraction:**
   - `char[] characterArray = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();`: The input integer is first converted to a string using `String.valueOf(num)`, and then the string is converted to a character array. Each digit of the input number is now a separate character in the `characterArray`.

3. **Sorting Digits:**
   - `Arrays.sort(characterArray);`: The character array containing the digits of the input number is sorted in ascending order. After sorting, the array contains the digits in ascending order.

4. **Minimum Sum Calculation:**
   - The return statement calculates the minimum sum as follows:
     - `(characterArray[0] - '0') * 10 + (characterArray[2] - '0')`: This converts the first digit (smallest after sorting) and the third digit (second smallest after sorting) to integers and constructs a two-digit number using the tens and units places.
     - `(characterArray[1] - '0') * 10 + (characterArray[3] - '0')`: Similarly, this converts the second digit (second largest after sorting) and the fourth digit (largest after sorting) to integers and constructs another two-digit number.

5. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The two calculated two-digit numbers are then added together to get the final result. This final result is the minimum sum achievable by rearranging the digits of the input number.

Here's a brief example using the input number `3174`:
- The character array after sorting becomes `1374`.
- The first two digits are `1` and `3`, so `(1 * 10) + 3 = 13`.
- The next two digits are `4` and `7`, so `(4 * 10) + 7 = 47`.
- The sum of `13` and `47` is `60`, which is the minimum sum.

## In summary, the code sorts the digits of the input number, constructs two two-digit numbers using the smallest and second smallest digits, and the second largest and largest digits respectively. It then calculates the sum of these two constructed numbers, which represents the minimum possible sum achievable by rearranging the digits of the input number.
