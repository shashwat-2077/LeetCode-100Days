1. **Combining IDs**: The main idea is to gather all user IDs involved in friend requests, whether they are the requester or the accepter. To achieve this, the query uses a subquery with `UNION ALL` to combine the `requester_id` and `accepter_id` columns from the `RequestAccepted` table into a single column named `id`.

2. **Creating the `all_people` Subquery**: The subquery `(SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted UNION ALL SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted) AS all_people` creates a temporary table (`all_people`) that contains all unique user IDs related to friend requests. This prepares the data for further processing.

3. **Counting Friends for Each Person**: The outer query then operates on the `all_people` subquery. It uses the `GROUP BY id` clause to group the rows by the user IDs (`id`), and then the `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of rows in each group. This count represents the number of friends for each person.

4. **Sorting in Descending Order**: The `ORDER BY num DESC` clause sorts the result set in descending order based on the friend count (`num`). This ensures that the person with the most friends will appear at the top of the result set.

5. **Limiting the Result**: Finally, the `LIMIT 1` clause restricts the result set to only one row, which corresponds to the person with the highest number of friends. Since the problem states that only one person has the most friends, this is sufficient to identify that person.

## In summary, the query combines the requester and accepter IDs from the `RequestAccepted` table, counts the occurrences of each ID to determine the number of friends, sorts the results by friend count in descending order, and then limits the output to the person with the most friends using the `LIMIT 1` clause.
