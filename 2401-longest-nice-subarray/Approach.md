### Let's break down the given Java code for finding the longest "Nice" subarray step by step:

1. **Method Signature**: The code defines a method named `longestNiceSubarray` that takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns an integer.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `ans` is initialized to 0. It will store the length of the longest "Nice" subarray found.
   - `usedBits` is initialized to 0. It's a bitmask that keeps track of the bits used in the current subarray.

3. **Loop Initialization**: 
   - Two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) are initialized to 0.
   - The loop continues as long as `r` is less than the length of the `nums` array.

4. **Main Loop**: 
   - Inside the loop, there's a while loop that runs as long as there are duplicate bits in the `usedBits` for the current subarray. This is achieved by checking `(usedBits & nums[r]) > 0`.
   - During this while loop, it removes the leftmost element of the subarray (at index `l`) from `usedBits` by using the XOR operation `usedBits ^= nums[l++]`. This effectively moves the left pointer `l` to the right until there are no duplicate bits in the subarray.
   
5. **Updating `usedBits`**:
   - After removing duplicates from the left, the code updates `usedBits` by using the bitwise OR operation `usedBits |= nums[r]` to include the current element `nums[r]` in the subarray.

6. **Updating `ans`**: 
   - The code calculates the length of the current subarray (`r - l + 1`) and updates the `ans` variable with the maximum of its current value and the calculated length. This ensures that `ans` always stores the length of the longest "Nice" subarray encountered so far.

7. **Repeat**: 
   - The process continues as the right pointer `r` moves to the right, and the while loop may run to remove duplicate bits and update the `usedBits` until `r` reaches the end of the `nums` array.

8. **Return**: 
   - Finally, when the loop finishes, the function returns the value stored in `ans`, which represents the length of the longest "Nice" subarray in the given `nums`.

## In summary, this code uses a sliding window approach with two pointers (`l` and `r`) to find the longest subarray in the input `nums` such that all the bits in the subarray are unique. It efficiently handles this by maintaining a bitmask `usedBits` to keep track of the bits used in the current subarray and removing duplicate bits from the left end of the subarray as necessary.
