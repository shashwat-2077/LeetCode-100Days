## The code implements a text justification algorithm that takes an array of words and a maximum width as input, and outputs a list of strings where the words are distributed across lines in a way that each line has a total width of the specified maximum width. The algorithm aims to evenly distribute spaces between words on each line, while ensuring that the spaces are added as evenly as possible.

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an empty list called `ans`, which will store the final justified lines.
   - Initialize an empty list called `row`, which will temporarily store words on a line being constructed.
   - Initialize an integer variable `rowLetters` to keep track of the total number of letters (characters) in the current line.

2. **Loop through words**:
   - Iterate through each word in the input array `words`.
   - Check if adding the current word to the current line would exceed the maximum width (`maxWidth`). If it would, it's time to finalize the current line and add it to the `ans` list.
   
3. **Justification for the current line**:
   - Calculate the number of spaces needed to fill the remaining space on the line: `spaces = maxWidth - rowLetters`.
   - If the current line contains only one word (edge case):
      - Add `spaces` number of spaces after that word.
   - If the current line contains multiple words:
      - Distribute the spaces evenly between the words as much as possible.
      - Use modulo arithmetic to distribute the spaces among all the gaps between words (except the last gap).
      - Append spaces to the `StringBuilder` objects in the `row` list.
   
4. **Join the current row**:
   - Create a string by joining the contents of the `StringBuilder` objects in the `row` list. This represents the current justified line.
   - Add the joined line to the `ans` list.
   
5. **Reset the row**:
   - Clear the `row` list to start constructing a new line.
   - Reset the `rowLetters` count to 0.
   
6. **Add the last row**:
   - After processing all words, there might be remaining words in the `row` list that need to be added to the last line.
   - Join these words with a single space between them to form the last line.
   - Create a `StringBuilder` object `sb` with the last line content.
   - Calculate the number of spaces needed to reach the `maxWidth` and append that number of spaces to the `sb` object.
   - Add the justified last line to the `ans` list.

7. **Return the result**:
   - Return the list `ans`, which contains all the justified lines.

## Overall, this algorithm constructs each line by adding words to a `row` and ensuring the spaces between words are distributed as evenly as possible to match the `maxWidth` constraint. It then constructs and adds each justified line to the final output list.
