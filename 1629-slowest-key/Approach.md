## Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

### Step 1: Initialize Variables
- Initialize a variable `max_duration` to keep track of the maximum duration (time difference between consecutive release times).
- Initialize a variable `slowest_key` to keep track of the slowest key.
- Initialize a variable `prev_release_time` to store the release time of the previous key.

### Step 2: Iterate through the Input Arrays
- Iterate through the array of release times and the corresponding string of keys.
- For each iteration, calculate the duration by subtracting the `prev_release_time` from the current release time.
- If the calculated duration is greater than the current `max_duration`, update `max_duration` and `slowest_key` with the current key.
- Update `prev_release_time` with the current release time for the next iteration.

### Step 3: Return the Result
- After iterating through all the release times and keys, `slowest_key` will hold the key that took the longest time to be released.
- Return `slowest_key` as the result.

This approach iterates through the release times and keys only once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of keys pressed. The space complexity is O(1), as only a few extra variables are used.
