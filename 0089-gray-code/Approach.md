## â€‹The code is an implementation of generating Gray codes for a given number of bits, where a Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position. The provided code generates Gray codes using an iterative approach. 

### Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Class Definition:**
   The code defines a class named `GrayCode`.

2. **Method `grayCode(int n)`:**
   This method takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of bits for the Gray codes to be generated. It returns a list of integers representing the generated Gray codes.

3. **List Initialization:**
   Inside the method, an `ArrayList` named `ans` is initialized to store the generated Gray codes. The initial value of 0 is added to this list, as it's a common starting point for Gray codes.

4. **Generating Gray Codes:**
   The code uses a nested loop to generate Gray codes. The outer loop runs `n` times (once for each bit position), and the inner loop iterates through the existing Gray codes in reverse order.

   - **Outer Loop (`for` loop with `i`):**
     The outer loop runs from 0 to `n-1`. This loop controls the bit positions that will be toggled to generate the Gray codes.

   - **Inner Loop (`for` loop with `j`):**
     The inner loop iterates through the existing Gray codes stored in the `ans` list in reverse order (from the last to the first).

   - **Generating New Gray Codes:**
     For each iteration of the inner loop, a new Gray code is generated by flipping the `i`-th bit of the existing Gray codes using a bitwise OR operation. This operation is performed by calculating `(ans.get(j) | 1 << i)`. Here, `1 << i` is used to create a bitmask with only the `i`-th bit set to 1, which is then bitwise OR-ed with the existing Gray code. This generates a new Gray code that differs from the existing Gray code only in the `i`-th bit position.

   - **Adding New Gray Codes:**
     The newly generated Gray codes are added to the `ans` list.

5. **Returning Result:**
   After both loops complete execution, the `ans` list contains the generated Gray codes. The method returns this list as the final result.

## In summary, the code iteratively generates Gray codes by flipping one bit at a time while iterating through the existing Gray codes in reverse order. This approach ####dfvadfkjvnjknvensures that the generated Gray codes satisfy the property of differing in only one bit position between consecutive codes.
