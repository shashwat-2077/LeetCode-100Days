1. `class RandomPickIndex {`: This line defines a class named `RandomPickIndex`.

2. `public Solution(int[] nums) {`: This is a constructor for the `RandomPickIndex` class. It takes an array of integers named `nums` as input. The purpose of this constructor is to initialize the `nums` array, which will be used by the `pick` method.

3. `this.nums = nums;`: Inside the constructor, it assigns the input array `nums` to the class member variable `this.nums`. This allows other methods in the class to access and manipulate the `nums` array.

4. `public int pick(int target) {`: This is a method named `pick`. It takes an integer `target` as input and returns an integer representing an index where the given `target` value is found in the `nums` array. The returned index is chosen randomly based on a specific probability distribution.

5. `int ans = -1;`: Initializes an integer variable `ans` to -1. This variable will be used to store the index of the picked element.

6. `int range = 0;`: Initializes an integer variable `range` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the range within which a random number is generated.

7. **For Loop**: The loop iterates through each element in the `nums` array:
   - `for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i)`: The loop iterates through the `nums` array from start to finish.
   - `if (nums[i] == target && rand.nextInt(++range) == 0)`: Checks if the current element at index `i` is equal to the given `target`. If it is, it generates a random number using `rand.nextInt(++range)` and checks if it's equal to 0. This ensures that the probability of choosing the current index is `1/range`, which increases as more elements with the target value are encountered in the array.

8. `ans = i;`: If the condition in the previous step is satisfied, it sets the value of `ans` to the current index `i`. This means that the current index is randomly chosen based on the probability distribution explained above.

9. `return ans;`: After the loop is done, the method returns the value of `ans`, which represents a randomly chosen index where the `target` value is found in the `nums` array.

10. `private int[] nums;`: This line declares a private member variable `nums` of type integer array. It holds the array of integers passed to the constructor.

11. `private Random rand = new Random();`: This line declares a private member variable `rand` of type `Random`. It's used to generate random numbers, which is essential for the random index selection process.

## In summary, the code defines a class `RandomPickIndex` with a constructor to initialize an array of integers and a method `pick` to randomly select an index where a given target value appears in the array. The probability of selecting each index is higher for elements that have been encountered fewer times while matching the target value.
