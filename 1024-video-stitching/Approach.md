## â€‹The code is a Java class named `VideoStitching` that contains a method `videoStitching`. This method takes two arguments: a 2D array of `clips` representing video clips and an integer `time` representing the total time you want to cover with these clips. The goal of the method is to find the minimum number of clips required to cover the entire time interval.

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach used in this code:

1. Initialize variables:
   - `ans`: This variable will store the answer, i.e., the minimum number of clips needed to cover the entire time.
   - `end`: This variable represents the current endpoint of the covered time interval. Initialize it to 0, as we start with an empty time interval.
   - `farthest`: This variable represents the farthest endpoint among the clips that can be used to extend the current interval. Initialize it to 0.
   - Sort the `clips` array based on the starting time of each clip, which is represented by `clips[i][0]`.

2. Iterate through the `clips` array while trying to cover the entire time:
   - Use a `while` loop to continue until `farthest` reaches or exceeds the `time` you want to cover.
   - Inside the loop, another `while` loop is used to find clips that can be used to extend the current time interval. This inner loop iterates through the clips that start before or at the current `end` time.
   - If a clip's starting time is less than or equal to the current `end`, it means this clip can be used to extend the current time interval. Update `farthest` to be the maximum of its current value and the ending time of this clip, and increment the index `i` to move to the next clip.
   - If `end` and `farthest` are the same, it means no progress can be made, and the function should return -1, as it's impossible to cover the entire time.

3. After finding a clip that can extend the current time interval, increment the `ans` variable to count the number of clips used.

4. Update the `end` variable with the value of `farthest`, as the covered time interval has now been extended.

5. Continue the outer loop until `farthest` reaches or exceeds the `time`. The `ans` variable keeps track of the number of clips used to cover the entire time.

6. Return the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of clips required to cover the entire time. If it's not possible to cover the entire time, the function returns -1 as mentioned earlier.

## This approach sorts the clips and iteratively extends the time interval using clips that have the earliest starting time and the farthest ending time within the current interval. It ensures that you use as few clips as possible to cover the entire time, and if it's not possible, it returns -1.
