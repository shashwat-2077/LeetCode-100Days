## The code solves the "Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum" problem. The problem asks for finding the maximum sum of a subarray where the elements are in ascending order. 
### Let's break down the approach used in the code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize two variables: `maxSum` and `currentSum`, both set to the first element of the input array `nums`. These variables will keep track of the maximum ascending subarray sum and the current ascending subarray sum, respectively.

2. **Iterating through the Array:**
   - Start iterating through the `nums` array from the second element (index 1) since the first element was used for initialization.
   - For each element at index `i`, compare it with the previous element (`nums[i-1]`) to check if the current element is greater than the previous element.
   
3. **Checking Ascending Order:**
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[i-1]`, it means that the current element contributes to an ascending sequence. In this case, update the `currentSum` by adding `nums[i]` to it. This extends the current ascending subarray.
   
4. **Starting a New Subarray:**
   - If `nums[i]` is not greater than `nums[i-1]`, it means the ascending sequence has been broken, and a new ascending subarray needs to be started. Therefore, set `currentSum` to `nums[i]` to start a new subarray.
   
5. **Updating Maximum Sum:**
   - After processing each element, update the `maxSum` by taking the maximum of the current `maxSum` and the `currentSum`. This step ensures that the `maxSum` always holds the maximum sum found so far in the ascending subarrays.
   
6. **Iteration Completes:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, the `maxSum` will hold the maximum sum of an ascending subarray.

7. **Return Result:**
   - Return the calculated `maxSum` as the final result.

## In summary, the code iterates through the array, maintaining the current sum of an ascending subarray and updating the maximum sum found so far. When an element breaks the ascending order, the current subarray sum is reset to the current element, and the process continues. The algorithm keeps track of the maximum sum throughout the iteration and returns the maximum sum of any ascending subarray in the given array.
