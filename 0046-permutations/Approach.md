## â€‹The code is a Java implementation of finding all permutations of an array of integers `nums` using depth-first search (DFS) and backtracking. The goal is to generate all possible permutations of the input array `nums`.

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. The `permute` method is the entry point for generating permutations. It initializes an empty ArrayList called `ans`, which will store all the permutations.

2. It also initializes a boolean array called `used`, where each element represents whether the corresponding element in `nums` has been used in the current permutation or not. Initially, all elements are marked as unused (false).

3. It starts the DFS search by calling the `dfs` method with the initial state, including `nums`, `used`, an empty `path`, and the `ans` list.

4. The `dfs` method is a recursive function that performs depth-first search to generate permutations.

5. In the `dfs` method, the base case is checked. If the size of the `path` list is equal to the length of the input array `nums`, it means that a permutation has been completed. In this case, a copy of the `path` list is added to the `ans` list to record the permutation.

6. If the base case is not met, the code proceeds to generate permutations. It iterates through each element in the `nums` array.

7. For each element at index `i`, it checks whether `used[i]` is true. If it's true, it means that this element has already been used in the current permutation, so it skips this iteration using `continue`.

8. If `used[i]` is false, it marks `used[i]` as true, indicating that this element is now used in the current permutation.

9. The element `nums[i]` is added to the `path` list, representing the current partial permutation.

10. The `dfs` method is recursively called with the updated state (including the updated `path` and `used` arrays) to explore further permutations.

11. After the recursive call returns, the most recently added element (`nums[i]`) is removed from the `path` list, and `used[i]` is set back to false. This is the backtracking step, allowing the algorithm to explore other permutations.

12. The loop continues, trying the next available element in the `nums` array until all possible permutations are generated.

13. Once all permutations have been explored, the `permute` method returns the `ans` list, which contains all the permutations of the input array `nums`.

## In summary, this code uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with backtracking to generate all permutations of an input array. It maintains a `path` list to keep track of the current permutation and a `used` array to keep track of which elements have been used. When a complete permutation is found, it is added to the `ans` list, and the algorithm backtracks to explore other permutations. This process continues until all permutations have been generated and stored in the `ans` list.
