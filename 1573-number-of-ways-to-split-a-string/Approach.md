## â€‹The code defines a class called `NumberofWaystoSplitaString` with a method `numWays` that calculates the number of ways to split a string into three non-empty substrings such that each substring has the same number of '1' characters. The method uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and returns the result modulo 1,000,000,007 (`kMod`).

### Let's break down the approach step by step:

1. Initialize Constants:
   - The constant `kMod` is set to 1,000,000,007. This will be used for taking the modulo of intermediate and final calculations to avoid overflow.

2. Count the Number of Ones:
   - Count the total number of '1' characters in the input string `s` using the `chars()` method and the `filter()` operation.
   - Store the count of ones in the variable `ones`.

3. Handle Edge Cases:
   - If the count of ones is not divisible by 3, then there's no way to split the string into three substrings with the same number of ones. In this case, the method returns 0.
   - If the count of ones is 0, it means all characters in the string are '0'. In this case, the method calculates the number of ways to split a string of length `n` into three non-empty substrings using the formula `((n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2) % kMod` and returns the result.

4. Determine Split Points:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of split points: `s1End`, `s2Start`, `s2End`, and `s3Start`. These variables will be used to mark the positions in the string where the splits occur.
   - Initialize `onesSoFar` to keep track of the number of ones encountered while iterating through the string.

5. Iterate through the String:
   - Loop through each character of the input string using an index `i`.
   - Whenever a '1' is encountered, increment the `onesSoFar` counter.

6. Find Split Points:
   - When `onesSoFar` reaches `ones / 3`, it means the first substring should end at position `i`. Set `s1End` to `i`.
   - When `onesSoFar` reaches `ones / 3 + 1`, it means the second substring should start at position `i`. Set `s2Start` to `i`.
   - When `onesSoFar` reaches `ones / 3 * 2`, it means the second substring should end at position `i`. Set `s2End` to `i`.
   - When `onesSoFar` reaches `ones / 3 * 2 + 1`, it means the third substring should start at position `i`. Set `s3Start` to `i`.

7. Calculate and Return the Result:
   - Calculate the number of ways to split the string by multiplying the differences in split points: `(s2Start - s1End) * (s3Start - s2End) % kMod`.
   - Cast the result to `int` and return it as the final answer.

## The approach effectively tracks the positions where the splits should occur based on the distribution of '1' characters in the input string and calculates the number of valid split combinations using modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.
