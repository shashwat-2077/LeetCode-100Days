## This code is almost identical to the one previously explained. It is designed to detect cycles in a 2D grid of characters using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. 

### Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Main Function: containsCycle**
   - This function takes a 2D character array `grid` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the grid contains any cycles.
   - It initializes the dimensions of the grid (`rows` and `columns`), and a boolean array `seen` of the same dimensions to keep track of visited cells.

2. **Outer Loop through Grid Cells**
   - The function iterates through each cell `(i, j)` in the grid using two nested loops.
   - If the cell `(i, j)` has already been visited (`seen[i][j]` is true), it skips to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, it calls the `dfs` function to check if there's a cycle starting from the current cell `(i, j)`.

3. **DFS Function: dfs**
   - The DFS function takes the grid, current cell coordinates `(i, j)`, previous cell coordinates `(prevI, prevJ)`, the character `c` of the current cycle being explored, and the `seen` array as inputs.
   - It marks the current cell `(i, j)` as visited by setting `seen[i][j]` to true.

4. **Exploring Neighboring Cells**
   - The function iterates through four possible directions using the `dirs` array. Each iteration considers a neighboring cell `(x, y)` relative to the current cell `(i, j)` based on the direction.

5. **Boundary and Previous Cell Checks**
   - For each neighboring cell `(x, y)`, the code first checks if `(x, y)` is outside the boundary of the grid. If it is, the iteration continues to the next direction.
   - It also checks if `(x, y)` is the same as the previous cell `(prevI, prevJ)`. This condition is used to prevent immediately going back to the previous cell, which would result in an immediate loop.
   - If neither of these conditions is met and the character at cell `(x, y)` matches the character `c`, it proceeds to check for cycles in the neighboring cell using recursion.

6. **Recursion and Cycle Detection**
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the function recursively calls itself with the neighboring cell `(x, y)` as the new starting point. It also passes the current cell `(i, j)` as the previous cell coordinates to prevent going back.
   - During recursion, if the neighboring cell `(x, y)` has already been visited (`seen[x][y]` is true), then a cycle has been detected, and the function returns true.
   - Otherwise, the recursion continues exploring other neighboring cells.

7. **Returning Results**
   - If the DFS exploration from the current cell `(i, j)` does not find any cycles, the function returns false.
   - If the DFS exploration finds a cycle, the function returns true, indicating that the grid contains at least one cycle.

## The overall approach remains consistent with the previous explanation: using DFS to traverse through the grid, exploring each cell and checking for cycles by following paths of matching characters. The `seen` array prevents revisiting cells, and the previous cell information prevents immediate backtracking.
