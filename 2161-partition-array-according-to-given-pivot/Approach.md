## â€‹The code defines a class `PartitionArrayAccordingtoGivenPivot` with a method `pivotArray` that aims to rearrange an array of integers such that all elements less than a given pivot value appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, and finally, elements greater than the pivot. The rearranged array is stored in a new array called `ans`, which is then returned. 

### Let's break down the approach in detail:

1. **Method Definition: pivotArray**
   - This method takes two parameters: an integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`.

2. **Initializing Variables**
   - An integer array `ans` of the same length as the input array `nums` is created to store the rearranged elements.
   - An integer variable `i` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the index where elements should be placed in the `ans` array.

3. **Loop through Elements Less Than Pivot**
   - The first loop iterates through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   - If the current element `num` is less than `pivot`, it is placed in the `ans` array at the index indicated by `i`, and then `i` is incremented.

4. **Loop through Elements Equal to Pivot**
   - The second loop iterates through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   - If the current element `num` is equal to `pivot`, it is placed in the `ans` array at the index indicated by `i`, and then `i` is incremented again.

5. **Loop through Elements Greater Than Pivot**
   - The third loop iterates through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   - If the current element `num` is greater than `pivot`, it is placed in the `ans` array at the index indicated by `i`, and then `i` is incremented once more.

6. **Returning the Rearranged Array**
   - After all three loops are complete, the `ans` array contains the rearranged elements: first, elements less than `pivot`, then elements equal to `pivot`, and finally, elements greater than `pivot`.
   - The `ans` array is then returned as the result of the `pivotArray` method.

## The code's purpose is to partition the input array into three sections based on the pivot value. Elements less than the pivot are placed at the beginning, followed by elements equal to the pivot, and then elements greater than the pivot. The use of the `i` index variable ensures that the elements are placed in the correct order in the `ans` array. This approach essentially sorts the array based on the pivot value while maintaining the original order of elements within each partition.
