## The code implements a solution to find the year with the maximum population based on a set of birth and death logs. 
### Let's break down the approach used in detailed points:

1. **Initialization**:
   - An array `years` of size 2051 is created. This array will store the changes in population for each year from 1950 to 2050. The size is chosen to cover the years from 1950 to 2050, inclusive.

2. **Populating the Changes Array**:
   - The input `logs` is a 2D array where each subarray represents a birth-death log. For each log, the birth year's index in the `years` array is incremented by 1, and the death year's index is decremented by 1.
   - This step effectively accumulates the net change in population for each year based on the birth and death events.

3. **Finding Maximum Population Year**:
   - The code initializes two variables, `maxPopulation` and `maxYear`, both set to values corresponding to the year 1950. These will be used to track the year with the maximum population and the maximum population count.
   
4. **Iterating through Years**:
   - A loop iterates through the years from 1951 to 2050.
   - For each year, the change in population is updated by adding the population change of the previous year. This accumulates the population changes to obtain the current population for each year.

5. **Updating Maximum Population Year**:
   - During the loop, for each year, the code compares the population of that year with the maximum population found so far.
   - If the population of the current year is greater than the previously recorded maximum population, then the maximum population and maximum year variables are updated accordingly.
   
6. **Returning the Result**:
   - After iterating through all years, the code returns the `maxYear`, which represents the year with the maximum population.

## In summary, the approach involves accumulating the net population changes for each year based on birth and death events. By iteratively calculating the current population for each year and updating the year with the maximum population, the code efficiently finds the year with the highest population count. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of birth-death logs.
