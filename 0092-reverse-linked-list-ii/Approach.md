## â€‹The `reverseBetween` method is used to reverse a sublist of a given singly linked list, specified by the indices `m` and `n`. 

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in this code:

1. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The method starts by checking for two edge cases:
     - If the input `head` is `null`, meaning the linked list is empty, it returns `head` as there is nothing to reverse.
     - If `m` is equal to `n`, which implies that there is no need to reverse any sublist, it also returns `head`.

2. **Create a Dummy Node**:
   - To simplify the code and handle edge cases where `m` is 1, a dummy node is created with a value of 0, and its next pointer is set to the `head` of the original linked list. This dummy node serves as the new head of the modified list and helps in handling the case where the sublist to reverse starts at the beginning of the list.

3. **Initialize `prev` and `tail` Pointers**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `prev` and `tail`, both initially pointing to the dummy node. `prev` will be used to keep track of the node before the sublist `[m, n]`, and `tail` will be used to track the tail of the sublist.

4. **Move `prev` to the Node Before the Sublist `[m, n]`**:
   - Using a loop, move the `prev` pointer `m - 1` steps forward to point to the node just before the sublist `[m, n]`. This is done to properly connect the reversed sublist to the previous part of the list.

5. **Reverse the Sublist `[m, n]`**:
   - Use a loop to reverse the sublist `[m, n]` one node at a time. The loop runs for `n - m` iterations because you need to reverse `n - m + 1` nodes.
   - Within the loop, do the following steps for each iteration:
     - Create a `cache` pointer and set it to the `next` node of `tail`. This temporarily stores the next node in the original list.
     - Update the `next` pointer of `tail` to point to `cache.next`. This effectively detaches `tail` from the original list.
     - Update the `next` pointer of `cache` to point to `prev.next`. This connects `cache` to the reversed part of the list.
     - Finally, update the `next` pointer of `prev` to point to `cache`. This links the previous part of the list to the newly reversed sublist.
   
6. **Return the Modified List**:
   - After the sublist `[m, n]` is reversed, return the `next` pointer of the dummy node, which points to the new head of the modified list.

## In summary, this algorithm creates a dummy node to simplify edge cases, finds the node before the sublist to reverse (`prev`), reverses the sublist `[m, n]` by iteratively updating pointers, and finally returns the modified list. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n - m), where n and m are the indices of the sublist to reverse.
