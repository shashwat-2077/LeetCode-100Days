## â€‹The code generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows `numRows`. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. 

### Here's a detailed explanation of the code's approach:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A `List<List<Integer>>` called `ans` is initialized to store the rows of Pascal's Triangle.
   - A `for` loop iterates through each row from 0 to `numRows - 1`.

2. **Creating Rows**:
   - Inside the loop, an `Integer[]` called `temp` is created to represent the current row.
   - The length of `temp` is set to `i + 1` because the first row has one element, the second row has two elements, and so on.
   - `Arrays.fill(temp, 1)` is used to fill all elements of `temp` with the value 1, as the first and last elements of each row in Pascal's Triangle are always 1.

3. **Adding Rows to the Result List**:
   - The filled `temp` array is converted to a `List<Integer>` using `Arrays.asList(temp)`.
   - This newly created list is added to the `ans` list, effectively adding the current row to the list of rows representing Pascal's Triangle.

4. **Filling in the Inner Values**:
   - After the initial rows with 1s are added, the code enters a second loop starting at `i = 2` (i.e., the third row of Pascal's Triangle).
   - Inside this loop, another nested loop iterates through the elements of the current row (excluding the first and last elements because they are always 1).
   - For each element at `ans.get(i).get(j)`, it is calculated by adding the corresponding elements from the previous row: `ans.get(i - 1).get(j - 1)` and `ans.get(i - 1).get(j)`.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - After generating all the rows and filling in the inner values, the `ans` list contains the complete Pascal's Triangle up to `numRows`.
   - The function returns `ans`.

## In summary, the code first initializes a list of lists to store Pascal's Triangle. Then, it generates each row by filling it with 1s, and subsequently fills in the inner values by summing the elements from the row above. Finally, it returns the generated Pascal's Triangle as a list of lists.
