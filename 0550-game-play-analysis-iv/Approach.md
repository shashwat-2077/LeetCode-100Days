## The SQL query is aimed at calculating the fraction of players who logged in for the first time exactly one day after they registered, out of all the players who have participated in any activity. 

### Let's break down the approach used in this query step by step:

1. **Subquery to Calculate First Login Dates**: The subquery labeled as 'b' calculates the earliest login date for each player. It does this by using the `MIN(event_date)` function and grouping the records by the `player_id` column. This subquery essentially creates a temporary table with two columns: `player_id` and `first_logged`, where `first_logged` represents the first login date for each player.

2. **Main Query with Inner Join**: The main query has three subqueries. The first subquery (nested inside the `ROUND` function) calculates the count of distinct `player_id` values for those players who logged in exactly one day after their first login. The second subquery calculates the total count of distinct `player_id` values across all activities.

3. **Inner Join with Date Difference Check**: The main query then joins the 'Activity' table with the subquery 'b' using an inner join. The join is performed based on matching `player_id` values and checking if the difference between the `event_date` in the 'Activity' table and the `first_logged` date in the subquery 'b' is exactly 1 day (`DATEDIFF(a.event_date, b.first_logged)=1`).

4. **Counting and Fraction Calculation**: The count of distinct `player_id` values resulting from the inner join represents the count of players who logged in for the first time exactly one day after their registration. The second subquery's result represents the total count of players who have participated in any activity. The division of these two counts yields the fraction of players meeting the criteria.

5. **Rounding the Fraction**: The final result is the fraction calculated from the division of the counts. It is rounded to two decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

### In summary, the query goes through the following steps:

- Calculate the first login date for each player using a subquery.
- Join the 'Activity' table with the subquery using an inner join, filtering for players who logged in one day after their first login.
- Calculate the fraction of these players out of all players who have participated in any activity.
- Round the calculated fraction to two decimal places.

### However, please note that the query has some limitations and assumptions:
- It assumes that the 'Activity' table contains a column named `event_date` and a column named `player_id`.
- The query might not handle cases where a player logs in multiple times on the second day.
- The efficiency of this query might not be optimal for large datasets due to the subqueries and joins involved.
