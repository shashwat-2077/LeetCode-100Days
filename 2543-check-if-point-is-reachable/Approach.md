## The given code defines a Java class called `CheckifPointIsReachable`, which contains methods for determining whether a point with coordinates (targetX, targetY) is reachable from the origin (0,0) using a specific condition. 

### Let's break down the approach in detailed points:

1. Class Definition: The class `CheckifPointIsReachable` contains a public method named `isReachable` and a private helper method named `gcd`. The public method is used to check if a given point is reachable, and it takes two integer parameters, `targetX` and `targetY`, which represent the X and Y coordinates of the target point.

2. `gcd` Method: The private method `gcd` stands for "greatest common divisor" and is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers, `a` and `b`, using the Euclidean algorithm. It recursively computes the GCD until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a`.

3. `isReachable` Method: This public method is used to determine whether the point with coordinates `(targetX, targetY)` is reachable from the origin `(0,0)`. The logic is as follows:
   
   a. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `targetX` and `targetY` by calling the `gcd` method.
   
   b. It then calculates the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of the GCD using `Integer.bitCount`. In other words, it counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of the GCD.

   c. It checks if the number of set bits in the GCD is equal to 1. If it is, the method returns `true`, indicating that the point is reachable. If not, it returns `false`, indicating that the point is not reachable.

4. How It Works:
   - The GCD of `targetX` and `targetY` is computed using the `gcd` method. The GCD represents the largest positive integer that can evenly divide both `targetX` and `targetY`.
   - The binary representation of the GCD is obtained.
   - The `Integer.bitCount` method counts the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation.
   - If there is exactly one set bit in the binary representation of the GCD, it means that the GCD is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, etc.), and this is the condition for a point to be reachable.

5. Conclusion: This code checks whether a point with coordinates `(targetX, targetY)` is reachable from the origin by determining if the GCD of `targetX` and `targetY` is a power of 2 (i.e., having only one set bit in its binary representation). If the condition is met, the point is considered reachable; otherwise, it is not reachable.
