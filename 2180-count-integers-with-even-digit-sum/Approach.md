â€‹## The given code defines a class `CountIntegersWithEvenDigitSum` with a method `countEven` that takes an integer `num` as input and returns the count of integers with an even digit sum that are less than or equal to `num`. ### The approach used in the code can be explained in detailed points as follows:

1. **Method Overview**: The `countEven` method aims to count the number of integers with an even digit sum within a given range, based on the value of the input integer `num`.

2. **Even Digit Sum Check**:
   - The method first checks whether the sum of digits of the given number `num` is even or not. It does this by calling the private method `sumOfDigits(num)` which calculates the sum of the digits of `num`.
   - If the sum of digits is even, the method returns `num/2`, indicating that half of the integers less than or equal to `num` will have an even digit sum.
   - If the sum of digits is odd, the method returns `(num-1)/2`, which also counts half of the integers less than or equal to `num` with an even digit sum. This is because subtracting 1 from an odd number makes it even, and then half of the even numbers have even digit sums.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation** (Private Method `sumOfDigits`):
   - This private method calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
   - It initializes a variable `sum` to keep track of the running sum of digits.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as the number `num` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration of the loop, the last digit of `num` is extracted using the modulus operator (`num % 10`), and this digit is added to the `sum`.
   - The last digit is then removed from `num` by performing an integer division (`num /= 10`).
   - This process continues until all digits of the number have been processed, and the loop exits.
   - Finally, the method returns the calculated sum of digits.

4. **Logic Rationale**:
   - The approach is based on the observation that even digit sums are more likely to occur for numbers with even sums of digits, and the calculation is based on this property.
   - For numbers with an odd sum of digits, decrementing the number by 1 makes the sum of digits even. Hence, counting half of the numbers less than or equal to `num` after subtracting 1 ensures the correct count of numbers with even digit sums.

5. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - The `sumOfDigits` method's time complexity is proportional to the number of digits in `num`, which is O(log num) in the worst case.
   - The `countEven` method has a constant time complexity since it only performs arithmetic operations and calls the `sumOfDigits` method once.

## Overall, this approach efficiently calculates the count of integers with even digit sums based on the sum of digits of the input number `num`.
