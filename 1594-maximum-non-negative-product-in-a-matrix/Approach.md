## The code is an implementation of an algorithm to find the maximum non-negative product path in a matrix. 
### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The code starts by defining a constant `mod` with the value 1,000,000,007, which is used to take the modulo of the final result to prevent overflow.
   - The number of rows and columns in the `grid` matrix is determined and stored in the `rows` and `columns` variables, respectively.
   - Two 2D arrays `dpMin` and `dpMax` are created, both having the same dimensions as the `grid` matrix. These arrays will store the minimum and maximum product values at each cell, respectively.
   - The first cell of both `dpMin` and `dpMax` is initialized with the value of the first cell in the `grid` matrix (`dpMin[0][0]` and `dpMax[0][0]`).

2. **Filling First Row and Column:**
   - The algorithm then iterates through the first row and first column of the `dpMin` and `dpMax` arrays, setting the product value at each cell to the product of the previous cell and the corresponding value from the `grid` matrix. This is done to handle the cumulative product calculation for the first row and column.

3. **Dynamic Programming Iteration:**
   - The core of the algorithm is a double-loop iteration over the remaining cells of the `dpMin` and `dpMax` arrays (starting from index [1][1]).
   - For each cell at index [i][j], the algorithm checks whether the value at the corresponding cell in the `grid` matrix is positive or negative.
   - If the value is negative:
     - The `dpMin` value at [i][j] is calculated as the maximum of the products from the above cell (`dpMax[i-1][j]`) and the left cell (`dpMax[i][j-1]`), multiplied by the negative value in the `grid` matrix at [i][j].
     - The `dpMax` value at [i][j] is calculated as the minimum of the products from the above cell (`dpMin[i-1][j]`) and the left cell (`dpMin[i][j-1]`), multiplied by the negative value in the `grid` matrix at [i][j].
   - If the value is non-negative:
     - The `dpMin` value at [i][j] is calculated as the minimum of the products from the above cell (`dpMin[i-1][j]`) and the left cell (`dpMin[i][j-1]`), multiplied by the positive value in the `grid` matrix at [i][j].
     - The `dpMax` value at [i][j] is calculated as the maximum of the products from the above cell (`dpMax[i-1][j]`) and the left cell (`dpMax[i][j-1]`), multiplied by the positive value in the `grid` matrix at [i][j].

4. **Final Result:**
   - After completing the dynamic programming iteration, the algorithm calculates the maximum of the values at the bottom-right cell of both `dpMin` and `dpMax` arrays. This value represents the maximum non-negative product path through the matrix.
   - If the calculated maximum value is negative, the algorithm returns -1 (indicating that there's no valid non-negative product path).
   - Otherwise, the algorithm returns the maximum value modulo `mod`, ensuring that the result is within the range of a 32-bit integer.

## The algorithm uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum and maximum product paths while considering both positive and negative values in the matrix.
