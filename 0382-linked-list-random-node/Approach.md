## â€‹The `LinkedListRandomNode` class appears to be designed to solve the problem of selecting a random node from a singly linked list with equal probability. 

### Below is a detailed explanation of the approach used in this class:

1. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor `public Solution(ListNode head)` takes a reference to the head of a singly linked list as its input argument and initializes the `head` member variable to this input head node.

2. **getRandom() Method**:
   - This method, `public int getRandom()`, is used to return a random node's value from the linked list.
   - It initializes two variables: `ans` to store the selected node's value and `i` to keep track of the current node's position in the linked list.
   - A `for` loop is used to iterate through the linked list. The loop starts at the `head` node and continues until it reaches the end of the list (i.e., `curr` becomes `null`). 
   - Inside the loop:
     - `rand.nextInt(i)` generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and `i` (exclusive). This random number is used to determine whether the current node should be selected as the answer.
     - If `rand.nextInt(i)` equals `i - 1`, it means that the current node is selected with a probability of `1/i`. This is because `rand.nextInt(i)` will produce `i - 1` with a probability of `1/i`.
     - When the current node is selected, its value (`curr.val`) is assigned to the `ans` variable.
   - After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the value of a randomly selected node from the linked list, with each node having an equal probability of being selected.

3. **Private Member Variables**:
   - `head`: This is a private member variable that stores the reference to the head of the linked list provided during object creation.
   - `rand`: This is a private member variable of type `Random` and is used to generate random numbers. It's initialized with a new instance of `Random` when an object of the class is created.

## In summary, this class allows you to efficiently select a random node from a linked list by iterating through the list while maintaining equal probability for each node. This is achieved by using the random number generator to probabilistically select nodes as the loop iterates, ensuring that each node has a 1/i probability of being chosen, where i is the position of the node in the linked list.
