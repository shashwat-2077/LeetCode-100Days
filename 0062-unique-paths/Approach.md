## ​The code is an implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the "Unique Paths" problem. This problem is often framed as finding the number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner of a grid (m x n) from the top-left corner, moving only right or down at each step. 

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of size m x n. This array will be used to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell (i, j) in the grid.
   - Initialize all cells of the `dp` array to 1 because there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or the first column – by moving either right or down.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a nested loop to iterate over each cell in the grid, starting from (1, 1) and going up to (m-1, n-1).
   - For each cell (i, j), calculate the number of unique paths to reach it by adding the number of unique paths from the cell above it (i-1, j) and the cell to the left of it (i, j-1). This is because you can only move right or down, so the unique paths to (i, j) are the sum of the paths to (i-1, j) and (i, j-1).

3. **Return Result**:
   - After the loop, the `dp` array will be fully populated with the number of unique paths to reach each cell.
   - Return the value stored in the bottom-right cell, which represents the total number of unique paths to reach the destination (m-1, n-1).

## The code efficiently uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations by building up the solution from subproblems. It ensures that each cell in the `dp` array stores the count of unique paths to reach that cell by considering the paths from the cells above and to the left. Ultimately, it returns the total number of unique paths to the destination cell, which is the bottom-right corner of the grid.
