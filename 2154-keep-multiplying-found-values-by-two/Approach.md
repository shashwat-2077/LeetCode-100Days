## The given code defines a class `KeepMultiplyingFoundValuesbyTwo` with a method `findFinalValue` that operates on an array of integers and an original integer value. 
### Let's break down the approach used in detail:

1. The method `findFinalValue(int[] nums, int original)` takes two parameters:
   - `nums`: An array of integers.
   - `original`: An integer value that serves as the base value for calculations.

2. Inside the method, a `HashSet` named `s` is initialized. This set will be used to store the unique integers from the `nums` array.

3. A `for-each` loop iterates through each element `num` in the `nums` array:
   - Each `num` is added to the `s` set. This step ensures that the set will contain only unique values from the `nums` array.

4. After populating the set with unique integers, the code enters a `while` loop with the condition `s.contains(original)`:
   - This loop checks if the current value of `original` is present in the `s` set. If it is, the loop continues.
   - The `original` value is left-shifted by 1 (equivalent to multiplying by 2). This doubling process continues as long as the `original` value is found in the set.

5. Once the loop condition is no longer met (i.e., the `original` value is not in the set), the loop exits.

6. The method then returns the final value of `original` after all the left-shift operations have been performed. This value will be the smallest power of 2 greater than the original value that is not present in the set `s`.

## In summary, the code aims to find the smallest power of 2 greater than the original value that is not present in the given array of integers. It uses a `HashSet` to store unique integers from the array and doubles the original value using left-shift operations until the resulting value is no longer present in the set. This ensures that the returned value is the smallest power of 2 greater than the original value and not present in the array.
