## The given code defines a class `BinaryTreePaths` with a method `binaryTreePaths` that calculates all the paths from the root to the leaf nodes of a binary tree. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to achieve this. Here's a detailed explanation of the approach:

1. **Method Overview**:
   - The `binaryTreePaths` method initializes an empty list `ans` to store the paths.
   - It calls the `dfs` method (Depth-First Search) to traverse the binary tree and find the paths.
   - The final list of paths is returned as the result.

2. **DFS Approach**:
   - The `dfs` method takes three parameters: the current `TreeNode` being processed, a `StringBuilder` to build the path, and the `ans` list to store the paths.
   - If the current `TreeNode` is `null`, it means we've reached a null node (a leaf or an absent child), so we return immediately.
   - If the current node is a leaf node (both left and right children are null), we append its value to the `StringBuilder` and add the resulting path to the `ans` list. Then, we return.

3. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - Before performing any operations, the `dfs` method stores the initial length of the `StringBuilder` (`sb`) in a variable `length`. This will be used to reset the `StringBuilder` later.
   - It appends the value of the current node to the `StringBuilder`, followed by a "->" separator, to represent the current path.
   - Then, the method makes two recursive calls to `dfs`, one for the left child and one for the right child of the current node.
   - After the recursive calls, the `StringBuilder` is reset to its original length using `sb.setLength(length)`. This step effectively removes the last part of the path, reverting it back to its previous state before the current node was processed.

4. **Building Paths**:
   - As the DFS traversal progresses, the `StringBuilder` `sb` is gradually built up to represent the current path from the root to the current node.
   - When a leaf node is encountered, its value is appended to the `StringBuilder`, and the complete path is added to the `ans` list.
   - Since the `StringBuilder` is reused and modified during the traversal, the resetting of its length is crucial to maintain the correct path while backtracking.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `binaryTreePaths` method returns the list of paths (`ans`) containing all the paths from the root to the leaf nodes of the binary tree.

## In summary, the code employs a depth-first traversal approach to explore the binary tree while building the paths from the root to the leaf nodes. The `StringBuilder` is used to construct the paths, and its length is managed carefully to ensure correct backtracking and path construction.
