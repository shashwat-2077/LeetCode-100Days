## â€‹The code is for solving the "Search in Rotated Sorted Array II" problem, which is an extension of the classic binary search problem. In this problem, you are given a rotated sorted array with duplicates, and you need to determine whether a given target value exists in the array.

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. Initialize two pointers, `l` and `r`, to represent the left and right boundaries of the search interval, respectively. Initially, `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `nums.length - 1`, which represents the entire array.

2. Start a while loop that continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. This loop will help in narrowing down the search interval until the target is found or it's determined that the target does not exist in the array.

3. Calculate the middle index `m` of the current search interval as `(l + r) / 2`.

4. Check if the value at the middle index `nums[m]` is equal to the target. If it is, return `true` immediately, indicating that the target has been found in the array.

5. Handle cases where there are duplicates at both ends of the current search interval (`nums[l]`, `nums[m]`, and `nums[r]` are all equal):
   - Increment `l` by 1 to move one step to the right while decrementing `r` by 1 to move one step to the left. This step eliminates duplicates from both ends of the current interval.

6. Check if the left half of the current interval (`nums[l..m]`) is sorted:
   - If `nums[l] <= nums[m]`, it means the left half is sorted. In this case, we can perform a standard binary search on the left half:
     - If the target is greater than or equal to `nums[l]` and less than `nums[m]`, update `r` to `m - 1` to search in the left half.
     - Otherwise, update `l` to `m + 1` to search in the right half.

7. Check if the right half of the current interval (`nums[m+1..r]`) is sorted:
   - If `nums[l] > nums[m]`, it means the right half is sorted. In this case, we can also perform a standard binary search on the right half:
     - If the target is greater than `nums[m]` and less than or equal to `nums[r]`, update `l` to `m + 1` to search in the right half.
     - Otherwise, update `r` to `m - 1` to search in the left half.

8. Repeat the above steps in the while loop until the search interval is narrowed down to a single element or until it is determined that the target does not exist in the array.

9. If the while loop completes without finding the target, return `false`, indicating that the target is not present in the rotated sorted array.

## This approach ensures that the code handles the presence of duplicates in the rotated sorted array and performs binary search to find the target efficiently.
