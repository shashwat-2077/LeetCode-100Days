## â€‹The code is a Java implementation of an algorithm to reconstruct an itinerary using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The goal is to find an itinerary that starts at the "JFK" airport and visits all other airports in a list of given flight tickets. The itinerary must follow the lexicographically smallest path. 

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. Initialize data structures:
   - `LinkedList<String> ans`: This is the list where we'll store the reconstructed itinerary.
   - `Map<String, Queue<String>> graph`: This is a map that represents the graph of airports and their destinations. Each airport is a key in the map, and the corresponding value is a queue of destination airports. The queue is implemented as a priority queue to ensure that we choose the lexicographically smallest destination first.

2. Build the graph:
   - Loop through each ticket in the `tickets` list.
   - For each ticket, extract the departure airport (ticket.get(0)) and the destination airport (ticket.get(1)).
   - Check if the departure airport is already a key in the `graph` map. If not, add it and initialize the corresponding queue.
   - Add the destination airport to the queue of the departure airport. The priority queue ensures that destinations are stored in lexicographically sorted order.

3. Start DFS:
   - Call the `dfs` function with the initial airport "JFK" and the `ans` list to begin the depth-first search.

4. Depth-First Search (DFS) function (`dfs` method):
   - The DFS function is a recursive function that explores the graph starting from a given airport.
   - It takes three parameters: the `graph` map, the current airport `u`, and the `ans` list where we store the itinerary.
   - Retrieve the queue of arrivals from the `graph` map for the current airport `u`.
   - While the queue is not empty and there are destinations to visit:
     - Recursively call the `dfs` function with the next destination airport as the new starting point.
     - This step effectively explores all possible routes from the current airport by picking the lexicographically smallest destination first and continuing the search.
   - Once all destinations have been visited, add the current airport `u` to the front of the `ans` list. This ensures that we reconstruct the itinerary in reverse order as the DFS stack unwinds.

5. Return the `ans` list:
   - After the DFS is complete, the `ans` list will contain the reconstructed itinerary in the correct order, starting from "JFK" and visiting all airports as required.

## The algorithm relies on DFS to explore all possible routes, and the use of a priority queue ensures that the destinations are chosen in lexicographically sorted order, satisfying the requirement of finding the lexicographically smallest itinerary.
