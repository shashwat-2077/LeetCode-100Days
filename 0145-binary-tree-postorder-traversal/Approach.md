## The code performs a postorder traversal on a binary tree and returns the values of its nodes in the traversal order. 
### Let's break down the approach used in this code in detailed points:

1. **Class Definition:** The code defines a class named `BinaryTreePostorderTraversal`.

2. **Method Definition:** Within the class, there's a method named `postorderTraversal`, which takes a single parameter `root` of type `TreeNode`. This method is intended to be the entry point for performing the postorder traversal on the binary tree.

3. **List Initialization:** Inside the `postorderTraversal` method, a new `ArrayList` named `ans` is created. This list will store the values of nodes in the postorder traversal order.

4. **Recursive Helper Method:** There's another private method named `postOrderTraverse`, which performs the actual postorder traversal. It takes two parameters: `root` of type `TreeNode` and `ans` of type `List<Integer>`.

5. **Base Case Check:** The `postOrderTraverse` method starts with a base case check. If the `root` node is `null`, it means we've reached a leaf node (or the tree is empty), so the method returns immediately, indicating the end of the traversal for this branch.

6. **Recursive Traversal:** If the `root` node is not `null`, the method proceeds with recursive traversal. It first recursively calls itself for the left subtree of the current `root` node by passing `root.left` and the `ans` list.

7. **Right Subtree Traversal:** After completing the left subtree traversal, the method similarly recursively calls itself for the right subtree of the current `root` node by passing `root.right` and the `ans` list.

8. **Add Node Value:** Once both left and right subtrees have been traversed, the value of the current `root` node (`root.val`) is added to the `ans` list. This step corresponds to the actual "visit" of the node in the postorder traversal.

9. **Complete Traversal:** The recursive calls will continue to traverse all nodes in the binary tree in a postorder fashion (left subtree, right subtree, current node), and the values will be added to the `ans` list in the correct postorder traversal order.

10. **Return Result:** After the traversal is complete, the `ans` list contains the postorder traversal of the binary tree, and it is returned as the result of the `postorderTraversal` method.

## In summary, this code employs a recursive approach to perform a postorder traversal of a binary tree. The traversal order is achieved by first traversing the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally adding the value of the current node to the list.
