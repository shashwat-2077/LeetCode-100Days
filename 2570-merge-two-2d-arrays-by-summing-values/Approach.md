# The given code defines a Java class named `Merge2DArraysbySummingValues` with a method `mergeArrays` that merges two 2D arrays while summing up the values based on their common indices. 
## The goal is to combine the two input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` and create a new array where values with the same index are added together. 

### The approach can be explained step by step:

1. The class `Merge2DArraysbySummingValues` contains a constant `maxIterate` set to 1000, which is used as the maximum possible index value in the arrays. This value is used to initialize an array `count` of size `maxIterate + 1` to keep track of the summed values at each index.

2. The method `mergeArrays` takes two 2D integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` as input and aims to merge them by summing up values at the same indices.

3. Inside the `mergeArrays` method:
   - A `List<int[]>` called `outputArray` is initialized to store the merged results.
   - The `count` array is initialized to keep track of the sum of values for each index. This array will later be used to create the merged output.

4. The method `addSimiliarCount` is called twice, once for each input array (`nums1` and `nums2`). This method iterates through each row of the input array, where each row is represented by a 1D array containing two values: an index `id` and a value `val`. For each row, it adds the `val` to the corresponding index in the `count` array.

5. After both input arrays have been processed using `addSimiliarCount`, the next step is to iterate through the `count` array (indices 1 to `maxIterate`) and check if there's a non-zero count for that index. If there is, it means there's a sum at that index, and a new 1D array with the index and the count is added to the `outputArray`.

6. Finally, the `outputArray` is converted to a 2D array using Java streams and returned as the merged result.

## In essence, the approach is to create a `count` array to keep track of the summed values at each index, iterate through both input arrays to accumulate values into the `count` array, and then iterate through the `count` array to construct the merged result.
