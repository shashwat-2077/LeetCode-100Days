## Let's go through the approach used in the `numSub` method in a step-by-step manner:

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The method `numSub` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes a constant `kMod` with the value 1,000,000,007. This value will be used to take the modulo operation and keep the result within a specified range.
   - It initializes two integer variables:
     - `ans`: This variable will store the count of valid substrings composed of only '1's.
     - `l`: This variable represents the index of the last encountered '0'. It is initialized to -1, indicating that no '0' has been encountered yet.

2. **Loop Through Characters:**
   - The method enters a loop that iterates through each character of the input string `s` using the index variable `i`.

3. **Check Current Character:**
   - For each character at index `i` in the loop:
     - If the current character is '0', it means that the sequence of consecutive '1's has been broken. We update the `l` variable to the current index `i`. This will be used as the starting point for the next valid substring.

4. **Calculate and Update Count:**
   - After handling the character at index `i`, the `ans` variable is updated:
     - The difference between the current index `i` and the last '0' index `l` is calculated.
     - The value of `kMod` is added to this difference to ensure that the result remains non-negative.
     - The sum of the above calculation is taken modulo `kMod` to prevent potential overflow and keep the result within a specified range.
     - This value is added to the current value of `ans`, updating the count of valid substrings.

5. **Loop Completion and Return:**
   - After iterating through all characters in the input string, the loop concludes.
   - The method returns the final value of `ans`, which represents the total count of consecutive substrings containing only '1's.

## The approach used here involves iterating through the characters of the input string `s` and maintaining a count of consecutive substrings composed of '1's. The index of the last encountered '0' is used to keep track of the starting point of each valid substring. The modulo operation is used to handle potential overflow and ensure the result remains within a specified range. This approach efficiently calculates the count of valid substrings without needing to explicitly generate and check each substring.
