## The code is an implementation of a solution to the "Maximum Length of Pair Chain" problem using a greedy approach. 

### Let's break down the approach step by step:

### Problem Description: Given a set of pairs, where each pair represents a range, you need to find the maximum length of a chain of pairs such that each pair (a, b) is followed by a pair (c, d) where b < c.

### Here's how the code works:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `ans`: This variable will store the length of the maximum chain.
   - `prevEnd`: This variable is used to keep track of the ending value of the previously added pair in the chain. It's initialized with the minimum possible integer value, so that any valid pair can be considered as the first pair.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The `pairs` array is sorted based on the ending value of the pairs using a custom comparator `(a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]`. This means that the pairs are sorted in ascending order of their ending values.

3. **Iterating Through Pairs:**
   - The code then iterates through each pair in the sorted `pairs` array.

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - For each pair in the array:
     - The code checks if the starting value of the current pair (pair[0]) is greater than the `prevEnd`. This condition ensures that the current pair can be added to the chain because its starting value is greater than the ending value of the previous pair.
     - If the condition is satisfied, it means the current pair can be added to the chain.
     - Increment the `ans` variable to count the length of the chain.
     - Update the `prevEnd` variable with the ending value of the current pair (pair[1]).

5. **Result:**
   - After iterating through all pairs, the `ans` variable will store the length of the maximum chain that satisfies the given conditions.
   
### The key idea in this approach is to sort the pairs based on their ending values and then iterate through them while keeping track of the ending value of the previous pair. By doing so, you ensure that you always choose the pairs with the smallest ending values that can be added to the chain, thereby maximizing the length of the chain.

### The approach is greedy because at each step, you make the locally optimal choice by selecting the pair that maximizes the length of the chain based on the current context.
