## The given code defines a Java class named `SellingPiecesofWood` with a method `sellingWood` that aims to maximize the profit from selling pieces of wood by cutting them into smaller pieces. The approach is implemented using dynamic programming. 

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` and `n` represent the dimensions of the original piece of wood. This array will store the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting pieces of wood of various sizes.
   - The dimensions of `dp` are one greater than the dimensions of the original wood because we are using 1-based indexing for convenience.

2. **Setting Initial Prices**:
   - For each element in the `prices` array, which contains information about the dimensions and prices of pre-cut pieces of wood, set the corresponding cell in the `dp` array to the given price.
   - This step ensures that the algorithm considers these pre-cut pieces when calculating the maximum profit.

3. **Dynamic Programming Iteration**:
   - Use nested loops to iterate through all possible dimensions of wood pieces.
   - The outer loop, `i`, represents the height (vertical dimension), and the inner loop, `j`, represents the width (horizontal dimension).
   - For each combination of dimensions `(i, j)`, we try to maximize the profit by cutting the wood into smaller pieces.

4. **Cutting Vertically**:
   - For each possible vertical cut, represented by `h`, iterate from `1` to `i / 2` (half of the height). 
   - Update `dp[i][j]` by comparing it with the maximum profit achievable by cutting the wood into two pieces of heights `h` and `i - h`, with the same width `j`. The maximum is determined by the sum of the profits obtained from the two smaller pieces.

5. **Cutting Horizontally**:
   - Similarly, for each possible horizontal cut, represented by `w`, iterate from `1` to `j / 2` (half of the width).
   - Update `dp[i][j]` by comparing it with the maximum profit achievable by cutting the wood into two pieces of heights `i` and the corresponding widths, `w` and `j - w`. Again, the maximum profit is determined by the sum of the profits obtained from the two smaller pieces.

6. **Result**:
   - After the nested loops finish, the `dp[m][n]` element of the array will store the maximum profit that can be obtained from cutting the original piece of wood into smaller pieces.

7. **Return Value**:
   - Return the value of `dp[m][n]` as the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling pieces of wood.

## The code efficiently uses dynamic programming to explore all possible cutting scenarios and select the one that maximizes the profit.
