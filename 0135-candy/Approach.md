## â€‹The code defines a class `Candy` with a method `candy` that takes an array of integers `ratings` as input and calculates the minimum number of candies required to distribute to a group of children such that each child is given at least one candy, and children with higher ratings receive more candies than those with lower ratings. The code implements a two-pass approach to compute the minimum number of candies required based on the given ratings. 

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach:

1. Define variables:
   - `n` is the number of elements in the `ratings` array, representing the number of children.
   - Initialize `ans` to 0, which will store the total minimum number of candies required.
   - Create two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `n`, to keep track of the number of candies assigned to the children from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - Initialize both `l` and `r` arrays with 1 because each child must receive at least one candy.

2. Calculate candies from left to right:
   - Use a loop to iterate through the `ratings` array from left to right (starting from index 1).
   - For each child (index `i`), check if their rating is higher than the rating of the previous child (at index `i - 1`).
   - If the rating is higher, increment the value in the `l` array for the current child by 1 more than the value for the previous child. This ensures that children with higher ratings receive more candies.
   - This loop populates the `l` array with the required number of candies for each child from the left side.

3. Calculate candies from right to left:
   - Use a loop to iterate through the `ratings` array from right to left (starting from the second-to-last index).
   - For each child (index `i`), check if their rating is higher than the rating of the next child (at index `i + 1`).
   - If the rating is higher, increment the value in the `r` array for the current child by 1 more than the value for the next child. This ensures that children with higher ratings receive more candies.
   - This loop populates the `r` array with the required number of candies for each child from the right side.

4. Calculate the total number of candies:
   - Iterate through the children (indices 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each child at index `i`, calculate the maximum number of candies required by taking the maximum value between `l[i]` (candies from the left) and `r[i]` (candies from the right).
   - Add this maximum value to the `ans` variable, accumulating the total minimum number of candies required.

5. Return the `ans` variable, which contains the minimum number of candies required to distribute among the children while meeting the given conditions.

## The code efficiently computes the minimum number of candies for each child by considering both left and right neighbors' ratings, ensuring that children with higher ratings receive more candies, and ultimately returns the total minimum number of candies needed for the entire group of children.
