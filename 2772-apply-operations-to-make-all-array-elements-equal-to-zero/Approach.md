## â€‹The Java code defines a class `ApplyOperationstoMakeAllArrayElementsEqualtoZero` that contains a method `checkArray`. The purpose of this method is to determine whether it is possible to make all elements of an integer array `nums` equal to zero using a specific operation. The method takes two parameters, an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach used in this code:

1. **Base Case Check:**
   - The method starts with a check for a special case. If `k` is equal to 1, the function returns `true`. This is because when `k` is 1, it's always possible to reduce any number to 0 by subtracting 1 repeatedly.

2. **Initialization:**
   - An integer variable `needDecrease` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of how much the elements in the sliding window (of size `k`) need to be decreased in total to make the array elements equal to zero.

   - A deque (double-ended queue) `dq` is used to maintain the elements within the current sliding window. It will be used to efficiently keep track of the elements within the window while also facilitating removal of elements that are no longer in the window.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The code then enters a loop that iterates through the elements of the `nums` array, one by one.

   - Inside the loop, the following steps are performed:

      a. **Removing Elements from the Window (if necessary):** If the size of the sliding window is equal to `k`, this means the window has slid one step to the right, and an element needs to be removed from the front of the deque. This element's value is also subtracted from the `needDecrease` variable.

      b. **Checking If Current Element Can Be Reduced:** It checks if the current element (`nums[i]`) is less than the current `needDecrease`. If it's not, it means that it's not possible to reduce the current element to zero using the operation, and the function returns `false`.

      c. **Calculating the Decreased Number:** The code calculates the decreased number by subtracting `needDecrease` from the current element `nums[i]`. This represents the new value of the element after applying the operation.

      d. **Adding the Decreased Number to the Deque:** The decreased number is then added to the deque, representing the current element within the sliding window. Additionally, the `needDecrease` is updated to include the decreased number, as it reflects the total amount by which elements in the window need to be decreased.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all elements in the `nums` array, the code returns `true` if the last element in the deque (i.e., `dq.getLast()`) is equal to 0. This means that all elements in the sliding window have been successfully reduced to 0, and it was possible to achieve the desired result.

## In summary, the code employs a sliding window approach to check if it's possible to reduce all elements in the array to zero using the provided operation. It efficiently tracks the necessary changes using a deque and checks for feasibility during the iteration. If it's possible, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
