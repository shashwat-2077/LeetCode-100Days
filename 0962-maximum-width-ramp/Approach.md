## The code defines a class `MaximumWidthRamp` with a method `maxWidthRamp` that takes an array of integers `nums` as input and returns the maximum width of a "ramp" in the array. A ramp is a subarray of `nums` such that `nums[j] >= nums[i]` where `i < j`.
### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a variable `ans` to keep track of the maximum width of the ramp.
   - Create a `Deque` (double-ended queue) called `numStack` using the `ArrayDeque` class. This stack will store indices of elements from the `nums` array.

2. **Finding the Left Boundary of Possible Ramps**:
   - Loop through each element `nums[i]` in the array `nums` using the index `i`.
   - Check if the `numStack` is empty or if the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than the element at the index stored at the top of the `numStack`. If either condition is true, push the current index `i` onto the `numStack`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Width of Ramps**:
   - Loop through the `nums` array in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving towards the first element, using the index `i`.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, check if the `numStack` is not empty and if the current element `nums[i]` is greater than or equal to the element at the index stored at the top of the `numStack`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, calculate the potential width of the ramp by subtracting the current index `i` from the index at the top of the `numStack`. Update the `ans` variable with the maximum of the current `ans` value and the calculated width.
   - Pop elements from the `numStack` until it's empty or until the condition is no longer satisfied. This step effectively searches for the maximum width of the ramp that ends at or before the current index `i`.

4. **Return the Maximum Ramp Width**:
   - After both loops are done, return the calculated maximum width `ans`.

## In summary, the algorithm scans through the array twice. In the first pass, it identifies the potential left boundaries of ramps and stores their indices in the stack. In the second pass, it starts from the right end of the array and calculates the maximum width of ramps that can end at each index, updating the `ans` variable accordingly. The final result is the maximum width of a ramp that can be formed in the given array.
