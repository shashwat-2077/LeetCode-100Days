## The code defines a class called `StepstoMakeArrayNonDecreasing` with a method `totalSteps` that calculates the total number of steps required to transform an array of integers into a non-decreasing array. The code uses dynamic programming and a stack-based approach to determine the maximum number of steps needed.

### Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Initialize Variables:
   - Initialize an array `dp` of integers to keep track of the number of steps needed to remove each element from the `nums` array.
   - Initialize a `Deque` (double-ended queue) named `stack` using the `ArrayDeque` class. This stack will be used to keep track of indices of elements in the `nums` array.

2. Iterate through the Array:
   - Loop through each element in the `nums` array using an index `i`.

3. Determine Steps to Remove Current Element:
   - Initialize a variable `step` to 1. This variable will keep track of the number of steps needed to remove the current element.
   - Use a while loop to iterate through the elements in the `stack` until it's empty or until the elements at the top of the stack are smaller than or equal to the current element `nums[i]`.
   - During this loop, update the `step` by taking the maximum of the current `step` and the value stored in the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the element at the top of the stack, plus 1. This ensures that the maximum number of steps is considered while removing elements.

4. Update dp and Stack:
   - After the while loop, if the `stack` is not empty, update the `dp` array at index `i` with the calculated `step` value. This means that to remove the current element, you would need at least the calculated number of steps.
   - Push the current index `i` onto the `stack` to keep track of it for future comparisons.

5. Calculate the Result:
   - After iterating through all elements of the `nums` array, use the `Arrays.stream(dp)` method to create a stream of the `dp` array elements.
   - Use the `max()` operation on the stream to find the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum number of steps needed to transform the array into a non-decreasing order.
   - Use `getAsInt()` to get the final result as an integer and return it as the answer.

## The approach utilizes dynamic programming to track the number of steps needed to remove each element from the array while maintaining a stack of indices to efficiently calculate the required steps for each element. The code finally calculates and returns the maximum number of steps needed to achieve a non-decreasing array.
