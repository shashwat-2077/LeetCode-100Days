## The code defines a Java class named `PrimePairsWithTargetSum` that aims to find pairs of prime numbers whose sum equals a given target value `n`. The code utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers and then checks for pairs of primes that sum up to the given target.
### Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Class Definition**: The code defines a class named `PrimePairsWithTargetSum`.

2. **`findPrimePairs` Method**:
   - The `findPrimePairs` method takes an integer `n` as input and is expected to return a list of lists containing pairs of prime numbers whose sum equals `n`.
   - It first calls the `sieveofEratosthenes` method to generate a boolean array `isPrime`, where `isPrime[i]` is `true` if `i` is a prime number and `false` otherwise.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the pairs of prime numbers that satisfy the given condition.

3. **`sieveofEratosthenes` Method**:
   - The `sieveofEratosthenes` method takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean array `isPrime` indicating whether each number up to `n-1` is prime or not.
   - It creates a boolean array `isPrime` of size `n` and initializes all entries to `true`.
   - Since `0` and `1` are not prime, the method explicitly sets `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` to `false`.
   - The method then iterates through numbers from `2` up to the square root of `n` (exclusive) using the variable `i`.
     - If `isPrime[i]` is `true`, it means `i` is a prime number, so the inner loop is executed to mark all multiples of `i` as not prime.
     - The inner loop starts from `i * i` and goes up to `n-1`, incrementing by `i` each time. This marks all multiples of `i` as `false` in the `isPrime` array.
   - After the loops complete, the `isPrime` array contains information about which numbers are prime.

4. **Prime Pair Generation**:
   - The main loop in the `findPrimePairs` method iterates over numbers from `2` to `n/2`.
   - It checks whether both `i` and `n-i` are prime according to the `isPrime` array generated earlier.
   - If both numbers are prime, it adds the pair `(i, n-i)` to the `ans` list.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - After iterating through the numbers and finding the prime pairs, the `ans` list contains all the pairs that meet the condition.
   - The method returns the `ans` list, which contains lists of prime pairs whose sum equals `n`.

## In summary, the code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given value `n`, and then it checks for pairs of primes that sum up to `n`. These prime pairs are collected in a list and returned as the final result.
