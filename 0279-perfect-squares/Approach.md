## The code implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to a given positive integer `n`. 

### Let's break down the code and approach step by step:

1. **Initializing Variables:**
   - `int[] dp`: This array will store the minimum number of perfect squares required to sum up to each number from 0 to `n`.
   - `Arrays.fill(dp, n)`: Initially, we fill the `dp` array with `n`, which is a value greater than the maximum possible number of perfect squares needed. This acts as an initialization step.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0] = 0`: Zero can be represented by using zero perfect squares.
   - `dp[1] = 1`: One can be represented by using one perfect square, which is `1^2`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Loop:**
   - We iterate from `i = 2` to `n`.
   - For each `i`, we try to find the minimum number of perfect squares required to represent `i`.
   - For this, we have an inner loop where we iterate over `j` from `1` to `sqrt(i)` (since `j * j` should be less than or equal to `i`).
   - The idea is to consider all possible perfect squares smaller than `i`, and for each square `j * j`, we check how many perfect squares are needed to represent `i - j * j`. The `+1` accounts for the current square we're considering (`j * j`).
   - We update `dp[i]` with the minimum value between its current value and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.

4. **Final Result:**
   - After the dynamic programming loop, the value of `dp[n]` will represent the minimum number of perfect squares needed to sum up to `n`.

5. **Return:**
   - Return `dp[n]` as the final result.

## The dynamic programming approach breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and builds up the solution iteratively. By considering all possible perfect squares for each number from `2` to `n`, the algorithm efficiently finds the minimum number of perfect squares needed to represent any given number `n`.
