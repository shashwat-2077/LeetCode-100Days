1. The `numberOfLines` method takes two inputs: an array `widths` representing the widths of characters in a font and a string `s` that needs to be written.

2. It initializes `lines` to 1, which represents the initial number of lines. It also initializes `currentWidth` to 0, which represents the width of the current line being formed.

3. The code uses a for-each loop to iterate through each character `c` in the input string `s`.

4. For each character, it calculates its width by accessing the `widths` array at the index corresponding to the character. Since the array `widths` is designed to hold the widths for characters 'a' through 'z', `c - 'a'` gives the index for the character.

5. It then checks whether adding the width of the current character to the current line width `currentWidth` would exceed the maximum width of 100. If it does, it means the current line can't accommodate the character, so it increments the `lines` counter to move to the next line and starts a new line with the width of the current character.

6. If the width of the character can fit within the current line, it simply adds its width to the `currentWidth`.

7. After iterating through all characters, the method returns an array containing the `lines` count and the final value of `currentWidth`.

## In summary, this code effectively simulates the process of writing the string using the given font widths and calculates the number of lines required to fit the entire string while adhering to the maximum line width constraint.
