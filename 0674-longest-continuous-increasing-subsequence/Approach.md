## The code is an implementation of an algorithm to find the length of the Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence (LCIS) in an array of integers. 
### Let's break down the approach step by step:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to keep track of the current subsequence being examined and initialize the variable `ans` (answer) to store the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence found.

2. **Loop through the array**: Start looping through the array `nums` from the beginning to the end using the `right` pointer. The loop iterates over each element in the array, considering it as a potential starting point of an increasing subsequence.

3. **Check for increasing sequence**: Inside the loop, there's a conditional check to determine if the current element is greater than the previous element (i.e., `nums[right] > nums[right-1]`). If this condition is met, it means that the current element extends the increasing subsequence. The `right` pointer is moved to the next element, and the loop continues.

4. **Reset `left` pointer**: If the current element is not greater than the previous element (i.e., the sequence is no longer increasing), it means that the current subsequence has ended. In this case, the `left` pointer is moved to the current position of the `right` pointer. This `left` pointer will now point to the potential new starting point of a new increasing subsequence.

5. **Update answer**: After either extending the subsequence or resetting the `left` pointer, the code calculates the length of the current subsequence (which is `right - left + 1`). It then updates the `ans` variable with the maximum length found so far.

6. **Repeat steps**: The loop continues until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array. At each step, the code checks whether the current subsequence is longer than the previous longest subsequence and updates the `ans` accordingly.

7. **Return answer**: Once the loop is done, the function returns the value of the `ans` variable, which represents the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence.

## In summary, this approach iterates through the array while maintaining a sliding window using the `left` and `right` pointers. It checks whether the current element continues the increasing subsequence, and if not, it updates the `left` pointer to potentially start a new subsequence. The algorithm keeps track of the maximum subsequence length (`ans`) throughout the loop and returns it as the final result.
