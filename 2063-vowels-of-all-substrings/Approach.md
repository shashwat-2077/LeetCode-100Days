## The `VowelsofAllSubstrings` class contains a method `countVowels` that takes a string `word` as input and returns the count of vowels in all possible substrings of the input word. 

### Let's break down the approach step by step:

1. Initialize a variable `ans` to keep track of the total count of vowels in all substrings. Start with `ans` set to 0.

2. Iterate through each character of the input `word` using a for loop. The loop variable `i` represents the starting index of the current substring.

3. Inside the loop, check if the character at the current index (`word.charAt(i)`) is a vowel by calling the `isVowel` method.

4. If the current character is a vowel (as determined by the `isVowel` method), calculate the contribution of this vowel to the total count of vowels in substrings.

5. The contribution of a vowel in a substring is calculated as `(i + 1) * (long) (word.length() - i)`. Let's break down this calculation:
   - `(i + 1)`: This part represents the number of substrings that start at index `i` and include the current vowel. Adding 1 to `i` accounts for the current vowel itself.
   - `(word.length() - i)`: This part represents the number of substrings that end at or after the current index `i`. Subtracting `i` from the total length of the word accounts for all possible endings of the substrings.

6. Add the calculated contribution to the `ans` variable, updating the total count of vowels in substrings.

7. Continue the loop until all characters in the `word` have been processed.

8. Finally, return the `ans` variable, which holds the total count of vowels in all possible substrings of the input word.

## To summarize, this approach calculates the count of vowels in all possible substrings of the input word by iterating through the characters, identifying vowels, and calculating their contributions to the count based on their positions within substrings. The result is the sum of these contributions, which is returned as the final answer.
