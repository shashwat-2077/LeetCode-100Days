## â€‹The code is a Java implementation of a solution to the "Frog Jump" problem using dynamic programming. The problem involves a frog trying to cross a river by jumping on stones placed at various positions. The frog can jump a certain distance (given by the value of the stone) in either the forward or backward direction. The task is to determine whether the frog can successfully reach the last stone. The provided code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define a class named `FrogJump`.
   - The `canCross` method takes an integer array `stones` as input, where `stones[i]` represents the position of the `i`-th stone.
   - Initialize the length of the `stones` array as `n`, which is the number of stones.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of dimensions `n x (n+1)` to store intermediate results. `dp[i][j]` will be `1` if the frog can jump from the `j`-th stone to the `i`-th stone, otherwise `0`.
   - `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the frog can reach the `i`-th stone from the `j`-th stone with a specific jump distance.

3. **Base Case**:
   - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating that the frog is initially at the first stone and has jumped 0 units (which is possible).

4. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - Iterate through each stone position from the second stone to the last stone (`i = 1` to `i = n-1`).
   - For each `i`, iterate through the previous stones (`j = 0` to `j = i-1`).
   - Calculate the jump distance `k` as the difference between the positions of the current stone (`stones[i]`) and the previous stone (`stones[j]`).

5. **Jump Possibilities**:
   - Check if the calculated jump distance `k` is greater than `n`. If it is, it's not possible for the frog to make that jump, so continue to the next iteration of the inner loop.
   - For each possible jump distance `x` (which can be `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1`), check if it's within the valid range (`0 <= x <= n`).

6. **Updating DP Table**:
   - If the jump distance `x` is within the valid range, update `dp[i][k]` by performing a bitwise OR operation with `dp[j][x]`. This operation signifies that if the frog can jump from the `j`-th stone to the `i`-th stone with a jump distance of `k`, then the frog can also reach the `i`-th stone with a jump distance of `k`.

7. **Final Result**:
   - After iterating through all stones and jump possibilities, return the result of whether there exists any valid jump distance from the last stone (`dp[n-1]`). Check if any value in the array is equal to `1`.

8. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where `n` is the number of stones. This is because for each stone, the algorithm iterates through all previous stones, and for each of those, it considers three possible jump distances.
   - The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the dynamic programming table.

## In summary, the provided code uses dynamic programming to determine whether the frog can cross the river by considering all possible jump distances and updating the DP table accordingly.
