## The code implements a solution for finding the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence of a given difference within an input array. 

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach:

1. **Method Signature**: The method `longestSubsequence` takes two parameters:
   - `arr`: An input array of integers.
   - `difference`: The desired common difference for the arithmetic subsequence.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `ans`: This variable keeps track of the maximum length of the arithmetic subsequence found so far and is initialized to 0.
   - `lengthAt`: This is a `Map` (HashMap) that associates each element in the `arr` with the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence that ends with that element. It is used to store intermediate results.

3. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - The code iterates through each element `a` in the input array `arr` one by one.

4. **Updating `lengthAt` Map**:
   - For each element `a`, it calculates the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending with `a` by looking up the length of the subsequence that ends with `a - difference` (if it exists) and adding 1 to it. This is done using the `lengthAt.getOrDefault(a - difference, 0) + 1` expression.
   - The result is then stored in the `lengthAt` map with the key `a`.
   
   For example, let's say `difference` is 3, and you have the following elements:
   ```
   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
   ```
   - When processing `a = 4`, `lengthAt.get(4 - 3)` is `lengthAt.get(1)` which is 1 (the length of the sequence ending at 1 is 1), so the length of the sequence ending at 4 becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
   - Similarly, when processing `a = 6`, `lengthAt.get(6 - 3)` is `lengthAt.get(3)` which is 2 (the length of the sequence ending at 3 is 2), so the length of the sequence ending at 6 becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
   
5. **Updating `ans`**:
   - For each element `a`, the code also updates the `ans` variable by taking the maximum value between the current `ans` and the length of the subsequence ending with `a`. This ensures that `ans` always contains the maximum length of the arithmetic subsequence found so far.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - After processing all elements in the input array, the code returns the final value of `ans`, which represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence with the given difference.

7. **Time Complexity**:
   - The code iterates through the input array once, performing constant-time operations for each element. Therefore, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the input array `arr`.

## In summary, this approach uses dynamic programming and a HashMap to efficiently calculate and store the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at each element in the input array, while also keeping track of the maximum length found overall.
