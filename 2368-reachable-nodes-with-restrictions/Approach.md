## The Java code is an implementation of a solution to a problem that involves finding the maximum number of nodes that can be reached in a graph, subject to certain restrictions. 

### Here's a detailed explanation of the approach used in the code:

**Problem Description**: You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph and an array `edges` containing edges between nodes. Additionally, you are given an array `restricted` that contains a list of nodes that cannot be visited. The goal is to find the maximum number of nodes that can be visited starting from node 0 while adhering to the restrictions.

**Approach Explanation**:

1. **Graph Representation**: The code starts by representing the given graph as an adjacency list. It uses an array of lists called `tree`, where `tree[i]` is a list of nodes connected to node `i`. This representation makes it easy to traverse the graph efficiently.

2. **Mark Restricted Nodes**: It initializes a boolean array `seen` of size `n` to keep track of nodes that are restricted and cannot be visited. It marks nodes from the `restricted` array as seen by setting their corresponding `seen` array elements to `true`.

3. **DFS Traversal**: The core of the algorithm lies in the `dfs` function, which performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the graph starting from node 0. DFS is a popular algorithm for traversing graphs. Here's how the DFS traversal works:

   - **Base Case**: If the current node `u` is restricted (i.e., `seen[u]` is true), the DFS function returns 0, as we cannot visit this node.
   
   - **Mark Current Node**: Otherwise, it marks the current node `u` as seen by setting `seen[u]` to true and initializes the `ans` variable to 1. The `ans` variable keeps track of the number of nodes visited starting from this node.

   - **Recursive Calls**: For each neighbor `v` of the current node `u`, it recursively calls the `dfs` function on `v` if `v` is not restricted. It adds the result of the recursive call to `ans`. This step explores all reachable nodes from the current node.

   - **Return**: Finally, the function returns the `ans`, which represents the total number of nodes visited starting from node 0 while adhering to the restrictions.

4. **Main Function**: In the main function, it initializes the graph representation, marks restricted nodes, and then starts the DFS traversal from node 0. The result of the DFS traversal is returned as the maximum number of reachable nodes.

## This code uses a depth-first search traversal to explore the graph and calculate the maximum number of nodes that can be visited starting from node 0 while respecting the restrictions imposed by the `restricted` array. The `seen` array helps keep track of visited and restricted nodes to avoid revisiting them.
